/**
 * Replaces null values in object properties with sentinel objects for iOS TurboModule compatibility.
 * Uses iterative stack-based traversal to avoid stack overflow on deeply nested structures.
 *
 * iOS TurboModules strip null values from object properties during serialization,
 * so we replace them with sentinel objects that can survive the serialization
 * and be detected/restored on the native side.
 *
 * Note: Null values in arrays are preserved by iOS TurboModules, so we don't
 * encode them (but we still process nested objects within arrays).
 *
 * @param data - The data to encode
 * @returns The encoded data with null object properties replaced by sentinels
